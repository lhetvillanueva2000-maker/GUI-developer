 * what's-new note that ships with a release, and the transient "Now designing
 * for Java Edition." that used to pop up from the bottom of the screen. They
 * were two mechanisms in two places before, which is how the app ended up with
 * a permanent strip at the top and a floating snackbar at the bottom saying
 * different things at the same time. One panel, one queue, one place to look.
 *
 * The strip that draws it is [NoticeStrip]. It sits exactly where the edition
 * tabs used to, which is deliberate: that row already read as "something about
 * the app rather than about the document".
